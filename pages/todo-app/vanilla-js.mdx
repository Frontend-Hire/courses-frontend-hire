Todo apps are a great way to learn a new language or framework. We teach this course with more than just Vanilla JavaScript.

A high-level overview of the things that this course will teach you:

- Good Project Setup for Vanilla JavaScript (Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint Staged)
- Testing with Vitest and DOM Testing Library

  We honestly don't recommend this course seriously, this is just to give a feel
  of what it feels like to build something without using libraries or
  frameworks. Though production-level projects can be built with Vanilla JS, we
  would just end up building a mini-framework. Libraries and frameworks like
  React and Svelte are built to solve the problems we would face if we were to
  build a mini-framework.
