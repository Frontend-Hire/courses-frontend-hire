# Setup Testing

Testing is tedius. Testing is boring. Developers avoid it.

Testing is important. Testing is necessary. Developers need to do it.

Manual testing is expensive and time consuming. Automated testing is cheap and fast.

Also, there are not a lot of testing tutorials out there as much as there are tutorials on how to build a web app. 

This causes a lot of developers to avoid testing just because of their lack of understading of the process and the tools. Even I don't like testing as a frontend developer. But I have a system that works for me and I want to share it with you. 

But first, we need to setup our tools.

## Vitest

Since we are using Vite, we greatly benefit from a native testing solution which is Vitest. You can read more about [Why Vitest here](https://vitest.dev/guide/why.html). 

Most companies out there use Jest for testing. Luckily, Vitest is compatible with Jest.

Either way, we need to install Vitest first. Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install -D vitest
```

Let us test if Vitest is working. The following steps are directly taken from the docs [here](https://vitest.dev/guide/#writing-tests).

<Steps>
### Create a file called `sum.ts` inside the `src` folder. Paste the following code inside it:

```ts filename="./src/sum.ts"
export function sum(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b
}
```

### Similarly, create a file called `sum.test.ts` inside the `src` folder. Paste the following code inside it:

```ts filename="./src/sum.test.ts"
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { sum } from './sum'

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3)
})
```

### Update yours `package.json` file to include the following script:

```json {7} filename="./package.json"
{
  // Rest of the file omitted for brevity

  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "test": "vitest",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "prepare": "husky install"
  },

  // Rest of the file omitted for brevity
}
```

### Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm run test
```

And then, you should see something like this:
![Sample Test Output](./screenshots/setup-testing-1.png)

</Steps>

In fact, this little test we wrote is what we call a `unit test`. It is a test that tests a small unit of code. In this case, we are testing the `sum` function. 

These kinds of tests are very important because they test the small units of code that make up your app. 

Also, using a __TDD__ (Test Driven Development) approach is easier with unit tests. You can straight away write the unit tests and then write the code to make the tests pass.

Okay, now that we have Vitest setup. We just need one more tool to finish our setup.

## React Testing Library (RTL)

<Callout>
I would first highly recommend: 
- You read the guiding principles of testing library [here](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles).
- You read the blog post on __Testing Implementation Details__ by Kent C. Dodds [here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details).

</Callout>

Either way, we need to install RTL so that we can test our React components. Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install -D @testing-library/react
```
