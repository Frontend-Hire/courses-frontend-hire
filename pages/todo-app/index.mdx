Todo apps are a great way to learn a new language or framework. I teach this course with more than just React.

A high-level overview of the things that this course will teach you:
- Good Project Setup for React (Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint Staged)
- React Hooks
- Component Composition
- Testing with Vitest and React Testing Library
