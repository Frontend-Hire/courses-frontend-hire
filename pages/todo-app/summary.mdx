# Summary

We learnt a lot of things in this mini-course.

Though we would love to continue this course to a full-fledged application. There are just too many tutorials out there that teaches you how to build a full-fledged application. We will not be doing that here.

Our goal was to teach you a good way to build a React application while learning some of the best practices in React and using TypeScript without much hassle. We also saw how TDD can help us write more confident code.

You could and should use this as a starting point to build your own application. In fact, a todo application (there are real apps out there that make millions) can be a resume worthy project. You can add more features to it and make it more interesting. Rember the optional priority prop? Try starting there.

Here's a project guide that you can follow to build a resume worthy project: [Todo App | Frontend Hire](https://www.frontendhire.com/projects/todo-app)
