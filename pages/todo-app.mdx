# Todo App with TypeScript and TDD

We teach you how to build a Todo App with TypeScript and TDD.

We support two UI libraries/frameworks: React and Svelte. Choose the one you prefer.

  We also have a Vanilla JS version but we don't recommend it. Though
  production-level projects can be built with Vanilla JS, we would just end up
  building a mini-framework. Libraries and frameworks like React and Svelte are
  built to solve the problems we would face if we were to build a
  mini-framework.
