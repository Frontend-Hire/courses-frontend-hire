# Good Naming

If we remove the JavaScript's reserved keywords (var, let, const, for, while, if, function) from a code base, what would we see? We would pretty much see the stuff that we or others named. This includes the names we gave our variables, functions and classes.

This chapter is all about how to name stuff in a good way. Remember we did not name the chapter "Best Naming", even the book ["Clean Code"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/) names the particular chapter as "Meaningful Names" because there are no hard and fast rules to naming stuff. It all boils down to our effort put in naming something.
