# Clean Code

<Callout type='info'>
  Clean Code is something that is irrelevant in interviews. But in your actual job, it would make a ton of difference! It's a good practice to write clean code, and it's a good habit to start early.

This course is greatly based out of our reading and understanding from the books [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/) and [The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-coder-the/9780132542913/) by the software legend [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) (also known as Uncle Bob).

We also make this course highly inclined towards frontend developers. We will refer the "Clean Code", "The Clean Coder" and others books, whenever we do refer, we will use informal referencing to not miss giving credits to the original authors!

The referencing would look something like this with links to the original source: [Clean Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/), [The Clean Coder](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-coder-the/9780132542913/).

<Callout type='warning'>
  This course is not a replacement for the books. We highly recommend you to read the books to get a deeper understanding of the concepts. We will take a lot of liberty to simplify the concepts and make it more relevant to frontend developers.

## What is Clean Code?

There are a lot of definitions but we would like to simply put it like this:

> Code that is easy to read without adding a lot of cognitive load.

Of course, trying to make our code clean will involve doing a lot of things right! This process does take time. 

Even if you are in a hurry, do not ignore clean code. The cost of fixing messy code is too much and little effort put now will cut the cost of fixing it later down by a lot!
