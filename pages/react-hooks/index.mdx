# Introduction to React Hooks

This is a fully interactive tutorial that will teach you almost everything you need to know about React Hooks.

By the way, before hooks were introduced, the only way to use state and other React features was by using class components. Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

It is now the recommended way to write React components.

We will only cover the most important hooks in this tutorial. Here are the hooks we will cover:

- `useState`
- `useRef`
- `useEffect`
- `Custom Hooks`
- `useContext`
- `useReducer`
- `useCallback`
- `useMemo`

We will refer to the official docs a lot.
