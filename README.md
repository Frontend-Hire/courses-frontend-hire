# Courses by YHR

## Introduction

This repo holds the written content for the courses offered by YHR. I teach these courses in-person and online for a charge. Though the written content is free, I would appreciate it if you would consider supporting me by sponsoring a course or two. You can find more information about the courses and how to sponsor them on the course [website](https://courses.iamyhr.com/).
